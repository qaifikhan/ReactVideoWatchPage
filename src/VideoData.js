    "description": "Preheat oven at 320Â°F. Lightly grease mini muffin pans with melted butter, then line each recess with strips of wax paper (1' wide x 3' long), crossing at base. Pulse cookies in a food processor until finely crumbled, then add melted butter to combine. Divide mixture into muffin pans and press firmly into bases. Prepare filling by mixing cream cheese, sugar and vanilla extract with an electric mixer. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Pulse sliced pineapple in a food processor into pulp and add to cream cheese mixture. Divide filling into muffin pans and bake 25-30 minutes until just firm. Cool slightly, then chill for at least 2 hours. Serving suggestion: Pipe some whipped cream over the cheesecake and top with a small slice of pineapple that's been dipped in Li-hing powder. Garnish with mint leaves.",
